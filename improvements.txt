Code Organization:

Consider organizing your code into multiple functions or classes to enhance readability and maintainability.
Separate the logic for reading Arduino data, updating the plot, and handling button clicks into different functions or methods.

Consistent Styling:

Keep your coding style consistent. For example, choose between using camelCase (self.graphicsView) and underscores (self.tableWidget), and stick to one style for better code consistency.

Avoid Hardcoding:

Avoid hardcoding values like the Arduino data update interval (t.start(50)) or the threshold temperature (if temperature > 50). Consider making these values configurable or constants for easier modification.

Error Handling:

Enhance error handling by providing meaningful error messages. For example, if there is an issue connecting to the Arduino or reading data, you could display a message to the user.

Separation of Concerns:

Consider separating the UI logic from the data collection and processing logic. This can make your code more modular and easier to test.

Documentation:

Add comments or docstrings to explain complex logic, especially within the update_data function. This will make it easier for others (or yourself) to understand the code in the future.

Avoid Infinite Loop:

The while True loop within the update_data function could potentially lead to an infinite loop. Ensure that there is a clear exit condition or a mechanism to stop the loop gracefully.

Responsive GUI:

Use Qt's signals and slots mechanism to make your GUI more responsive. The current implementation may freeze the GUI during long-running tasks.

Cleanup Resources:

Consider cleaning up resources such as closing the serial connection when the application is closed.

Thread Safety:

Since you are updating the UI from a separate thread (update_data function), make sure to use appropriate mechanisms to ensure thread safety.
